  Task: Fix Logic Error in GPA Calculation
  Instructions:
  The current GPA calculation logic in 'studentController.js' is incorrect. It divides the total grade points by the number of courses taken. 
  
  The correct formula for GPA is: Total Grade Points / Total Credits Completed.
  
  1. Identify the 'calculateGPA' function in 'repo/controllers/studentController.js'.
  2. Change the divisor from 'student.coursesTaken' to 'student.creditsCompleted'.
  3. Ensure that if 'creditsCompleted' is 0, the GPA remains 0 to avoid division by zero errors.
